This is what i did to set up ssh access.


For the port:

On HOST:

in Virtualbox Manager -> File -> Host Network Manager 
create new host-only network.
disable DHCP cause PDF says no to that.

set ip to something useable 
in my case : 192.168.99.1
with the subnet/network mask to be 255.255.255.252 or /30 

apply.

VM settings -> Network 
Adapter 1 should be NAT (Network address translator)
Advanced -> Port Forwarding 
Add a new Rule that has:
 protocol TCP, host ip: 192.168.99.1, host Port: 2000, Guest IP : 192.168.99.101, Guest Port: 690

 Guest port is the ssh port we will set later.

ok.

Adapter 2 set to Host-Only Adapter with the name being the newly created host-only network.

done with that nonsense.

machine Time! 

make sure service ssh is running with
    sudo service ssh status
as well as our networks.
    ifconfig -a OR ip -br -h -f inet a
initaly we should see 2,
lo at 127.0.0.1
and
enp0s3 at 10.0.2.15 or something similar.

thats great but now we gotta set up that third addapter.


MAKE sure you have done  either debian or ubuntu's section in /steps/ip_management


as user
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
standard config file, everything commented out.
find the line that says #Port, real close to the top, and remove the '#' on the line.
change the number to anything really between 50,000 and 65,000 so that you are in the safe zone.
in our case we set port to 690 
(anything bellow 1000 didnt seem to work or i was doing it wrong.. idk)


dissallow root account access:
Change PermitRootLogin's value to no

dissallow password auth aka only allow key auth: (Maybe after adding keys. havent tested.)
Change PasswordAuthentication's value to no



sudo service sshd restart


KEYGEN! not really sure how they wanted this done, besides you know, setting up the thing,
so we are going to use a RSA key from this local machine. 

if running properly:

    on Host: 
    ssh roger@192.168.99.1 -p 2000
    this should deny you because of the we dont allow passwords 

    now we create the RSA keys ssh-keygen

    now we move the rsa key to the machine with 
    ssh-copy-id roger@192.168.99.1 -p 2000

if this doesnt work, you'll have to edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and Change PasswordAuthentication's value to yes.
sudo service ssh restart 

then you should be able to copy the id, confirm with roger's password.
Now you can re-edit PasswordAuthentication's value to yes.
sudo service ssh restart



that should(?) conclude setting up the static ip's connection to host, ssh, using publickeys and blocking root access to system.
