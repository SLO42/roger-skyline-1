this is what i did to create the static ip and apply the specifc netmask

i followed this guy for this part. but only what i needed.
under the CLI section of course.

https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-set-a-static-ip-address-on-debian-10-buster


debian: 

if root then
	nano /etc/network/interfaces

if user then
	sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

inside nano
{
	# The loopback network interface
	auto lo eth0
	iface lo inet loopback

	# The primary network interface
add   ->auto enp0s8
add 1 ->iface enp0s8 inet static
add 2 ->	address 192.168.99.101
add 3 ->	netmask 255.255.255.252
}

1) we repalce dhcp with static to signify static ip that wont be auto reset
2) we add the custom static address of our choice.
3) we add the required netmask of /30 aka 255.255.255.252

restart the service: i used.

sudo systemctl restart networking

double check with:
	ip -br -h -f inet a

*flags
br : brief
h  : human readable
f  : family { inet } # allows us to only get the field we want.
a  : I think address. 


ubuntu: 


Create the Static ip that we will use.

i used netplan, i dont recommend it.

at /etc/netplan/
we will have some files, on being *.yaml
they have a specific type script so dont use any tabs...

enp0s3 should be left alone as it wont be our static ip.
`

network:
    ethernets:
        enp0s3:
            dhcp4: true
        enp0s8:
            dhcp4: false
            addresses: [192.168.99.101/30]
    version: 2

`
add the enp0s8 nonsense to declare the static ip of 192.168.99.101 with a subnet/netmask of 255.255.255.252 or /30

now do 

sudo service netplan --debug apply.

with the --debug flag you can see if any mistakes have been made.

@@@@

Sometimes a restart might not hurt, i dont really remember the ammount of times this machine has been reset

@@@



this should conclude setting up the static ip and setting the netmask of /30.

continue to ssh_PortnKeys.
